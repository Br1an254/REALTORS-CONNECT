Realtors connect is a small Web app whose purpose is to simplify the process of house hunting.
The app contains a location input and price input, you simply put the location or the price of the house you're looking for and it's displayed on the browser by clicking the submit button. Each apartment card contain the details button and remove button, the details button when clicked displays the realtors contacts details, the remove button when clicked removes a particular house the user is not interested in (so far the details and remove buttons are not functioning but will implement the features in the course of the week)

## Available location include.
NB// please copy and paste either the location and price or either then paste on their respective input options for them to be displayed, i experienced errors trying to display all available houses at initial app start then display filtered houses and could not figure how to do that on time (this will be implemented in the course of the week).
